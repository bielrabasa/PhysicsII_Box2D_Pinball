# DEVELOPMENT (solution to the problems we had)

### Tunneling:
The ball did not collide with the flippers sometimes, we fixed it by setting the ball in bullet.

### Bumper balls:
Bumpers did not make the ball bounce correctly, we fixed it by realising the coordinates of the ball object were not set in the center, but in the top-left corner.

### Sensor malfunction:
This bug is still happening in the release of the game, sensors only detect objects by one of the sides, we FUYM the result by separating all the sensors in the right part of the map by a bit.

### Mouse joint:
The mouse joint was very difficult to make as we figured out we had to update the target of the ball in each frame very late.
